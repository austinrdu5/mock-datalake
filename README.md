# Scalable Data Lake Architecture

A cloud-native data pipeline built to demonstrate scalable business operations and AI-ready data infrastructure. This mock datalake implementation prioritizes modern data engineering practices for enterprise-scale process optimization.

## Overview

This project implements a medallion architecture data lake designed to support AI-driven business operations. The system extracts data from multiple sources, standardizes it through robust transformation pipelines, and prepares it for downstream analytics and machine learning applications.

The architecture prioritizes scalability, data quality, and temporal analytics capabilities for modern business operations that rely on data-driven decision making and automated processes.

## Key Features

**Scalable Data Ingestion**
- Batch processing with configurable scheduling
- Multiple mock API sources (weather, financial, ecommerce, sales)
- Robust error handling and retry mechanisms

**Data Quality & Governance**
- Schema validation with Great Expectations and Pandera
- Data confidence scoring at the customer level
- Complete data lineage tracking for audit compliance
- Temporal schema design enabling time-travel queries

**Cloud-Native Architecture**
- AWS S3 integration for cost-effective storage
- PySpark for distributed data processing
- Parquet format for optimized analytics performance

**Enterprise Readiness**
- Designed to handle terabyte-scale data volumes
- Comprehensive test coverage with pytest
- Extensible framework for adding new data sources

## Technology Stack

- **Cloud Platform**: AWS (S3, IAM)
- **Data Processing**: PySpark, Python
- **Data Validation**: Great Expectations, Pandera
- **Storage**: Apache Parquet, EventStoreDB
- **APIs**: OpenWeatherMap, Alpha Vantage, Sales Systems
- **Testing**: pytest, custom validation suites

## Current Implementation

The project currently implements Bronze and Silver layers of the medallion architecture:

**Bronze Layer (Raw Data)**
- Extracts data from OpenWeatherMap API (weather data)
- Integrates with Alpha Vantage API (financial data)
- Processes sales transaction data
- All extractions include proper timestamping for temporal analysis

**Silver Layer (Standardized Data)**
- PySpark-based transformation pipelines
- Schema enforcement and data validation
- Temporal compatibility for time-series analysis
- Data quality scoring and lineage tracking

## Getting Started

1. Configure AWS credentials and S3 bucket access
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Set up API keys for data sources in configuration
4. Run extraction scripts in the bronze layer
5. Execute transformation pipelines for silver layer processing

## TODO

**Immediate Next Steps**
- [ ] Complete silver layer transformations for weather and sales data
- [ ] Implement comprehensive schema validation across all data sources\
- [ ] Add Great Expectations checkpoints for automated data quality monitoring

**Future Enhancements**
- [ ] Gold layer implementation for business-ready analytics
- [ ] Data catalog integration for metadata management  
- [ ] API management layer for external data access
- [ ] AI/ML model integration for predictive analytics
- [ ] Real-time streaming capabilities for operational dashboards
- [ ] Advanced monitoring and alerting systems
- [ ] Kubernetes deployment for container orchestration
